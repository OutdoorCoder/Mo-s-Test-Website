                <p>A primary contact person from your organization is required for coordinated communication throughout the duration of the contract. We maintain communication with clients throughout the proposal writing process in order to reduce confusion and increase likelihood of receiving funding.

Additionally, this person will be responsible for providing funder-required documents (such as IRS forms, audits, etc.) and budget justification information for each project.</p>

                <p>Having trained school district and agency staff to develop and manage grants and grant-funded programs, we are experienced in providing your organization with the tools your staff needs to write successful proposals.  After the initial meeting and after we provide you with the scope of work, you may decide your ultimate goal would be to write proposals yourself or train your staff to do so. We can provide the following:</p>
                <ul class="services-list">
                  <li><h4 class="services-section-subheader">Grant writing 101, the basics of grant research and development.</h4></li>
                  <li><h4 class="services-section-subheader">Training on researching grant opportunities and how to write proposals.</h4></li>
                  <li><h4 class="services-section-subheader">Program budget development and sustainability planning.</h4></li>
                  <li><h4 class="services-section-subheader">A review of proposals that you have written and provide feedback and coaching.</h4></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Grant writing training and consultation costs do not reflect travel costs. A separate training proposal and contract will be completed with the client should training be requested.</p>

                <p>Successful organizations have clearly defined visions, missions, and plans to achieve their goals. Without these in place, it’s easy for an agency to get off track. Our experience developing planning documents, leading strategic planning processes, and developing strategic initiatives is vital as we work with you and your organization to perform the work required to secure the future of your organization.</p>
